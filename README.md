Hello there Im Ernazar Torebaev. 
Im android developer and freelancer.
I code in kotlin and I use Android Studio for developing android native applications.
Ive created 2 similar apps. One of them working in Zarafshan and second one is in Nukus.
Most of all I like business than coding. Cause, one developer cant do things, that can do 100 developers.
Almost I think about how to automative all buisiness processes. Before I liked sport coding, but, couldnt earn any money from this.
Now I wanna leran backend, cause all interesting parts of developing in backend XD
